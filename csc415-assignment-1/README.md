# CSC415-Assignment-1
Assignment 1 – Command Line Arguments
Welcome to your First homework assignment.  

**Assignment Purpose and Learning Outcomes:**
- Getting your environment setup (the virtual machine)
- Getting you use to coding in C.
- Understanding how to utilize command line arguments which we use in all upcoming assignments.
- Using the Linux terminal
- Understanding paths
- Using git and Github

**Let me remind you of the general expectations for all projects:** 
- All projects are done in C in the Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine.
- Code must be neat, with proper and consistent indentation and well documented. 
- Keep line to around 80 characters per line, and not line greater than 100 characters.
- Comments must describe the logic and reason for the code and not repeat the code.  
- Variables must have meaningful names and be in a consistent format (I do not care if you use camelCase or under_scores in variables but be consistent.
- You must use `make` to compile the program.
- You must use `make run` (sometimes with RUNOPTIONS) to execute the program.
- In addition, each file must have the standard header as defined below.
- All source files and writeup must be in the main branch of the github.
  
All primary filenames should be `<lastname>_<firstname>_HW<#>_<component>.<proper extension>`, except Makefile.

Each .c and .h file must have a standard header as defined below.  Make sure to put in your section number (replace the #), your name, your student ID, a proper project name, GitHub name, filename, and description of the project.  Do not alter the number of asterisks and ensure that the header starts on line 1 of the file.

This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment.  You can (and should) work in groups to research how to do the assignment, but each person should code their own version and make their own submission.

This program is to demonstrate the usage of command line arguments in a C program.  You will write this to run in the Linux virtual machine.  The program should display the number of arguments from the command line and list each one on the console. 

Here is a sample execution:
 
```
student:~/CSC415$ make run RUNOPTIONS="Hello, these are overridden options 3 6 9"
gcc -c -o bierman_robert_hw1_main.o bierman_robert_hw1_main.c -g -I. 
gcc -o bierman_robert_hw1_main bierman_robert_hw1_main.o -g -I.  
./bierman_robert_hw1_main Hello, these are overridden options 3 6 9

There were 9 arguments on the command line.
Argument 00: 	./bierman_robert_hw1_main
Argument 01: 	Hello,
Argument 02: 	these
Argument 03: 	are
Argument 04: 	overridden
Argument 05: 	options
Argument 06: 	3
Argument 07: 	6
Argument 08: 	9
student:~/CSC415$
```

You must submit your source code file(s), Makefile, a writeup (use the provided template: https://docs.google.com/document/d/135ArZWTSw_KHVhUkYbq_A1D50C54eNCGwHymZTOOtwQ/edit?usp=sharing) in PDF format into your GIT repository and submit the writeup PDF into the assignment in Canvas.  Your write-up must include a description of the project and your approach, issues you had, how you overcame the issues and the compilation and execution output from your program (screen shots embedded in the PDF document. Your output must include commands with the command-line arguments.  The screen shots must be from command line to command line of the terminal.

All filenames should be `<lastname>_<firstname>_HW<#>_<component>.<proper extension>`
So my filename would be `Bierman_Robert_HW1_main.c`

You would modify the Makefile by entering your Lastname and Firstname (note no spaces).  Do not alter anything else in the Makefile.

```
# File: Makefile

LASTNAME=Bierman
FIRSTNAME=Robert
HW=1

RUNOPTIONS=Hello World


ROOTNAME=$(LASTNAME)_$(FIRSTNAME)_HW
FOPTION=_main
CC=gcc
CFLAGS= -g -I.
# To add libraries, add "-l <libname>", for multiple repeat prior for each lib.
LIBS =
DEPS = 
OBJ = $(ROOTNAME)$(HW)$(FOPTION).o

%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

$(ROOTNAME)$(HW)$(FOPTION): $(OBJ)
	$(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS)  $(LIBS)

clean:
	rm *.o $(ROOTNAME)$(HW)$(FOPTION)

run: $(ROOTNAME)$(HW)$(FOPTION)
	./$(ROOTNAME)$(HW)$(FOPTION) $(RUNOPTIONS)
```
