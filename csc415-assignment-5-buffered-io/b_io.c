* Project:: Assignment 5 â€“ Buffered I/O read
*
* File:: b_io.c
*
* Description::
* This C file implements buffered I/O operations with manual buffer management.
* It provides functions for opening, reading, and closing files (b_open, b_read, b_close).
* Each file descriptor corresponds to a file control block (FCB), 
* containing file information and buffer management variables. 
* The b_open function initializes the FCB, allocates buffer memory, 
* and returns the file descriptor. b_read reads data from the buffer or disk using LBAread,
* handling cases where requested bytes exceed buffer size. 
* b_close frees resources associated with the file descriptor.
